# [Deep-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification](https://github.com/Zahra-Bakhtiari/Deep-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification/blob/main/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20-%20Application.ipynb)
This repository covers a deep learning neural network based application for image classification which is a at/not-a-cat classifier.

The notebook includes steps for building and training a deep L-layer neural network, and then applying it to supervised learning and predictions on new entries.

Let's get started!
