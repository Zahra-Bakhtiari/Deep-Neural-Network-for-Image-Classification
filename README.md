# Deep-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification
This repository covers a deep learning neural network based application for image classification which is a at/not-a-cat classifier.

The notebook includes steps for building and training a deep L-layer neural network, and then applying it to supervised learning and predictions on new entries.

Let's get started!
